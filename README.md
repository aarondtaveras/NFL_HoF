# NFL Hall of Fame
Using Python and data science/visualization to figure out what it takes to make it into the NFL's Hall of Fame based on position and historical data.

# The first stage in this project is to be able to take the statistics of NFL Hall of Famers and plot them using a scatter plot.

This will give us a rough estimate of the type of stats a player would need to achieve Hall of Fame status. The program will receive one command line argument which is the position that the user would like to research. The program will then display the average relevant statistics needed for a player at this position to enter the Hall of Fame, and then plot all current Hall of Fame players on a scatter plot. The positions supported currently are: 'QB', 'RB', 'WR'.

# As of 12/11/18, the first stage is completed.

# The second stage will be to continue to make statistical adjustments to the data in order to create as accurate results as possible.

# The third step will be to predict the trajectory of current players to see if they're Hall of Fame bound. 

The goal is to remove as much speculation as possible from the equation of deciding whether or not a player, such as Odell Beckham Jr., is on track to become a pro football Hall of Famer or not.

Further steps (if any are taken) will be logged and implemented within this README and throughout the project's files.
