# NFL Hall of Fame
Using Python and data science/visualization to figure out what it takes to make it into the NFL's Hall of Fame based on position and historical data.

The first stage in this project is to be able to take the statistics of NFL Hall of Famers and plot them using a scatter plot.

This will give us a rough estimate of the type of stats a player would need to achieve Hall of Fame status. From here, we can start to analyze trends for Hall of Famers by year as well. For example, the average number of receiving yards needed to enter the Hall of Fame may be increasing with age due to the league becoming more and more pass heavy (or that is the assumption).

Our second stage will be to continue to make statistical adjustments to the data in order to create as accurate results as possible.

Our third step will then be to create an interface that allows users to input player statistics of their own in order to display in a line graph the road to the Hall of Fame this player is on. The goal is to remove as much speculation as possible from the equation of deciding whether or not a player such as Odell Beckham Jr. is on track to become a pro football Hall of Famer or not.

Further steps (if any are taken) will be logged and implemented within this README and throughout the project's files.
